Deep Learning on school laptops!

**How to use**      
This package is literally just a thin-ass wrapper deeplearn.js, with a HTML console because the school computers block Inspect Element. To use, edit the _source.js_ file to change the actual program itself. You likely won't want to touch anything else. This repo comes with the deeplearn.js library as a local file, so if you don't have wifi you can still program ;).

To run your program, double click, or open _console.html_.
